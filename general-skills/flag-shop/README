# simple integer overflow.

Printing the flag is guarded by a simple balance check.
So we need to "fix" our balance first by exploiting the overflow bug in the
'buy not the flag' branch before we can buy the real flag.

## Increase our balance

Select 'Defintely not the flag Flag' item.

To make `total_cost` overflow (so it is negative) to actually reach the line
which updates `account_balance`, enter a value so that
1. `total_cost = 900*number_flags` overflows
2. `account_balance = account_balance - total_cost` underflows

input >= INT_MAX/900 + a few more
min input: 2386095

## buy the flag

'cause now we have enough $
